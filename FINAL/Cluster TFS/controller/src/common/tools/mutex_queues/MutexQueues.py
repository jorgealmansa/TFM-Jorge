# MutexQueues:
# ------------
# This class enables to schedule and serialize operations concurrently issued
# over a number of resources. For instance, when multiple components want to
# configure devices through the Device component, configuration operations
# have to be serialized to prevent data corruptions, and race conditions, etc.
# Usage Example:
#   class Servicer():
#       def __init__(self):
#           # init other stuff
#           self.drivers = dict()
#           self.mutex_queues = MutexQueues()
#       
#       def configure_device(self, device_uuid, settings):
#           self.mutex_queues.wait_my_turn(device_uuid)
#           driver = self.drivers.get(device_uuid)
#           if driver is None:
#               driver = Driver(device_uuid)
#               self.drivers[device_uuid] = driver
#           driver.configure(settings)
#           self.mutex_queues.signal_done(device_uuid)
